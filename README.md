# Record Shop (Backend API Example Project)

This project is a **backend API** example for managing an inventory system for a fictional music store, **Northcoders Record Shop**. The API provides a structured and efficient way to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the shop's album inventory, designed using RESTful principles. This project serves as an example of how to implement a backend API for any similar use case, applying clean code practices, error handling, and robust testing.

## Overview

The purpose of this API is to manage the Northcoders Record Shop's album inventory. The store, previously relying on manual updates, now requires a system where data can be accessed and modified easily. This backend API allows users to query available stock, add new records, update existing ones, and remove outdated entries.

This README will guide you through the API's architecture, features, and how to interact with it. While designed for a music shop, the structure can be easily adapted to manage other inventory types.

## Key Features of the API

- **RESTful Architecture**: Built using standard HTTP methods and status codes.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions for managing album data.
- **Modular & Scalable**: Clean code with separation of concerns makes it easy to extend.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management ensures correct API usage and clear feedback for users.
- **Health Check**: Includes a `/health` endpoint for monitoring system status.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: The project is built with a focus on unit testing to ensure reliable functionality.
